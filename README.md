## ❓ What is Sound Control for macOS?

**Sound Control** is a utility that brings per-application volume control and advanced audio routing to macOS. Unlike the default system tools, Sound Control allows you to adjust sound levels independently for each app, apply system-wide equalizer settings, and reroute audio outputs without limitations.

It’s perfect for gamers, streamers, musicians, or anyone who needs more granular control over Mac audio.
